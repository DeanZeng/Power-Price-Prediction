# Power-Price-Prediction
Slovenian electricity spot prices forecasting.  

=People=

* Student: Ales Omerzel
* Proposer:  Dejan Velušček
* Mentor:  Dejan Velušček

=Summary of main goals=

Forecasting the electricity spot prices is an important tool for price as well as volumetric risk management and for optimal control in electricity production. Therefore, our main goal is to implement the computational intelligence model based on Bayesian statistics and machine learning, analyse results and present the errors. 

=Platforms and background=

* Potential programming languages are Python, R and Julia (new but very optimistic programming language). 
* Machine learning
